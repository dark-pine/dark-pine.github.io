                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">大家好！我叫周爱娜。Hey everybody! Eila here. Just testing out chinese characters:
                                I'm planning to write some posts about my mandarin studies, so it's good to verify the typesetting.</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">So, as has been established in the "About" section of this blog, the goal is to write posts about my hobbies and projects.
                                And what better project to start with, than the big one. The canoe. Everybody that knows us is aware that Steve and I have been utterly consumed 
                                with building a cedar strip canoe from scratch for the past five months. It's clear in my mind that this is the most ambitious project I've ever taken on,
                                one well worth sharing!</p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The Poor Man's Yacht</h2>
                            <blockquote class="blockquote">Anyone who follows the steps outlined in this guide will receive a thrill that at 
                                one time all but disappeared from marine pursuits: the pleasure of skimming over the water in a masterpiece
                                that is so intimately one's own. -Ted Moores, Canoecraft</blockquote>
                            <p>I'd say the seed for this project was planted when we went on an epic canoe journey last summer (perhaps later
                                to be detailed in a trip report) on the Spanish River. What a joy! How awesome, we thought, would it be to have a canoe of our very own?</p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Cue watching cedar strip canoe build videos on youtube, taking out "Canoecraft" by Ted Moores from the library, and copious 
                                hours daydreaming. A few hints were dropped to family and friends about the dream project, and the next thing we knew, we were cleaning out the 
                                garage at Steve's family cottage, and buying the most expensive plywood I'd seen in my life (due to covid-economics) for building the strongback 
                                and station forms. We were committed!</p>

                            <p>But, that's enough for a first blog post. If you're interested in seeing the current state of the project, feel free to visit my reddit,
                                linked by the little alien in the footer of this website. I've been posting a weekly update on the project, with a picture and a brief 
                                description of the work done that week.</p>
                            <p>For the next post, I'll go back to the very beginning - how I drafted the plans for the canoe, using the chart of offsets in Canoecraft!
                                Until then, goodbye, and may all beings be happy!</p>
