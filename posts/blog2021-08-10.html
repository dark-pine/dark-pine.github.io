                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">A book that has long been on my list</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Sapiens came out when I was in university, and has been on my list for years.
                                When I saw it out on the front tables during a Chapters visit, I figured it was finally time to pick up a copy of
                                my own and give it a go. I was not disappointed - overall it was a good read. It started out really strong, and I couldn't
                                put it down. However, the book loses some momentum partway through and it was a bit more effort to fully finish the book.
                            </p>
                            <p>The book is divided into several parts. I'll try to avoid summarizing all the author's points, but rather provide my opinion
                                on each part of the book.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Part One: The Cognitive Revolution</h2>
                            <p>This was by far my favorite part of the book. I enjoyed reading the wild speculation on the pre-historic era of humankind.
                                That is, pre-agricultural revolution. It was fun to think about what like may have been like when there were
                                multiple species of humans on the planet. A little disturbing, also, to think of the destructive powers of Homo Sapiens, and our part in
                                driving other humans and animals to extinction.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Part Two: The Agricultural Revolution</h2>
                            <p>Seems like Harari is of the opinion that the agricultural revolution was a disaster for humans. As he puts it, it was not us that
                                tamed grains, but rather grains that tamed us. Interesting to think that the average peasant, compared to the average
                                hunter gatherer, had a worse diet and longer working
                                hours as a result of the advent of agriculture. The trade-off, I suppose, was the ability to feed many more humans in a smaller area.
                                There was also a long section here 'debunking' reasons for why throughout history there have been far more patriarchal rather than
                                matriarchal societies. It was at this point that I think the author's style of making bold semi-unbacked claims started to lose steam.
                                In the cognitive revolution section, there is a huge amount of grey area that allows for speculation. However as the book progresses
                                through the ages, using 'pop-culture' factoids to make a point becomes markedly less powerful.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Part Three: The Unification of Humankind</h2>
                            <p>This is where I started to lose steam in the book. I think it simply was less interesting to me, as it focused more on the rise
                                and fall of religions, empires, etc. The section on money was good. His point about money being one of the unifying factors in enabling
                                cultures to work together and trade goods, despite having very different religious belief systems was the best part of this section.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Part Four: The Scientific Revolution</h2>
                            <p>The first half of this section was entirely the author expounding upon why the West was the most successful in conquering the world. I found
                                it interesting that the author tried to entirely attribute the success to be a specific European mindset of "discovering the unknown". It's
                                definitely presented as having been the "right" way to do things, which I think shows the author's bias. Again, as the book
                                progresses the bold semi-backed statements become ever more jarring.
                            </p>
                            <p>The last half of this section turns again to the question of happiness, and speculates on directions that humanity
                                could take in the future. The speculations are interesting, but again, there's certain generalisations that the author used to
                                emphasize how far science has come, that caused him to lose credibility. For example, in comparing modern-day sex changes to
                                historical eunuchs, he writes:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote class="blockquote">For instance, we can today not merely castrate a man, but also change his sex through
                                surgical and hormonal treatments.
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>I would argue that among the surgical treatments he alludes to, castration included, they are mostly cosmetic and do not provide function. As for the new
                                hormonal treatments, they are undoubtedly a huge leap for science and for allowing a person to present as the opposite sex,
                                however they are still a far cry from completely changing a human from one sex to the other. This un-backed statement-as-fact about a field
                                that still has a long way to go was jarring, and I believe there are many more like it in the book. For me, this slides the
                                book towards the light entertainment and speculative end of the universal history genre.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">In Summary</h2>
                            <p>Sapiens was a good read, especially for someone like myself who does not often read books on history. It had an extremely
                                ambitious scope, and did a fairly good job of touching on many different milestones in our collective past. However, the book
                                stumbles as it draws closer to the present day. The author's biases become more apparent, and the brief format of the book
                                can't handle the complexities of our modern-day debates. Overall, I give it a 3 out of 5 stars.
                            </p>
