                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Building the strongback</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Building the strongback was fairly straight forward. It's constructed out of two pieces of 4x8' plywood, which was cut into
                                the various sizes needed to build the box top and legs. The table is 16' long, and about a foot wide on top.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Milling the wood</h2>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/zFmZxzt/img2021-07-30-1.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Eila and Steve picking up the 16' long boards of select cedar.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Steve and I were determined to do this entire build ourselves, from scratch. That meant drawing our own plans, and it also
                                meant milling our own wood. It was a lot of work, but a lot of fun and we learned a lot. We got our wood from The WoodSource in Manotik,
                                they have great selection there and I'm sure we'll be back. We bought 16' long 1x6 boards. In retrospect, 17' long boards would have been better!
                                Because our canoe design was 16' long, the strips, when bent around the sides, were not quite long enough. We ended up butting strips together,
                                which I'll elaborate on in the next post.
                            </p>

                            <span class="caption text-muted">Milling the wood with the table saw.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">We milled the wood on this small table saw, using the strongback as the feed-out table. Having feather boards set tightly
                                here was invaluable. The first few strips the feather board wasn't pressing the wood against the fence strongly enough, so we ended up getting
                                some variation in our strip width.
                            </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Cutting all those strips was messy! It took us a couple of weekends to do it all, and the shop was absolutely covered in
                                sawdust. The masks were a must! After cutting the strips, we had to mill a "bead" and "cove" pattern into each of the strips.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/FWJfGfP/img2021-07-30-4.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The bead and cove pattern allows the strips to fit together nicely around all of the curves of the hull.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/tKCyVJS/img2021-07-30-5.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Cutting the forms</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">At this stage, we traced the canoe plans that had been previously drafted onto sheets of plywood. We then cut out these
                                forms using a jigsaw. The plan for these forms is to mount them on the strongback, one foot apart from each other. They will be used to hold the shape
                                of the cedar strips when it comes time to build the hull.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Building the stems</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Another important part of the preparations was getting the stems bent into shape. The inner and outer stems give structure
                                and strength to the canoe, and have to be bent before the hull is started, because the bow and stern forms will be in-accessible for bending once the 
                                strips start going on.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/yF14pqB/img2021-07-30-7.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">A PVC pipe filled with boiling water for bending the stems.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Some people build steam boxes to get their wood soft enough for bending, but we just filled this PVC pipe with boiling water,
                                put the strips for the stems in, and left it overnight.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/pXpHBNF/img2021-07-30-8.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Eila posing with the strips of pine and ash that have been bent around the bow/sterm form.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After the strips were bent into the right shape, they were allowed to dry for a week. When we came back, we took them off the forms,
                                made sure they were dry, and then glued them together. The inner stem is made of three strips of 1/4" thick pine, and the outer stem is three strips of 1/4" ash.
                                The pine is soft, light, and easy to shape, which is ideal for the inner stem. The ash meanwhile is strong yet still bendable. This extra strength is good
                                because the outer stem will see a lot more wear and tear. The inner and outer stems are also shaped together at the same time to ensure they will fit together
                                nicely on the actual canoe.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Setting up the forms</h2>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/pvPm5Tr/img2021-07-30-9.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Steve and Eila setting up the station forms.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">While we were waiting for the stems to set, we installed the station forms on the strongback. This took a lot of
                                careful calibration to ensure there was no twist along the length of the strongback. To do this, a centerline is marked on the surface
                                of the strongback, and a string jig is set up to mirror the centerline. Then, using a plumb bob, the string, and the centerline, we could align
                                the center of each form at both the top and bottom.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/XXJQGbX/img2021-07-30-10.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">All the forms setup and taped. Inner stems installed at the bow and stern.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Once the forms were installed and straight, the edges were covered with tape. This was to prevent the cedar strips from accidentally
                                getting glued to the station forms. The inner stems were also installed with the help of a temporary screw through the 6th station form into the end of
                                the stem, and a clamp at the bottom. Over time, the cedar strips will be glued to it and that will hold it in place.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Shaping the stems</h2>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/zXPXXFS/img2021-07-30-11.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Steve shaping the inner stem at the stern.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The final thing that needed to be done before we could start stripping the hull was shaping the inner stems. The inner stem is shaped so
                                that each cedar strip will lie flat as it contacts the stem. We shaped the vertical part of the stem with a trimming plane. As the stripping got closer to the horizontal
                                part of the stems, the required angle of the stem became clear, and the stem was further shaped.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The setup stage of building the canoe was filled with many incremental milestones. This was great for building confidence and getting
                                some small wins under the belt! The next stage of the canoe build is where things really got exciting. Building the hull. This was where all the painstaking
                                efforts we made to get the forms set up properly started paying off. It's also where we started to get a taste of just how beautiful this canoe was going to end up.
                                See you next time with the update on stripping the hull!
