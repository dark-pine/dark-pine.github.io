                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">At the beginning of October this year, Steve's dad Tim, in co-ordination with new-neighbor Chris,
                                threw an excellent Oktoberfest party at the cottage. It was a wonderful affair. There were decorations galour, activities to
                                titillate the most cautious of party-goers, and many mouthwatering delicacies. At the end of it all, everyone was so satisfied
                                that it was declared that this should surely become a yearly tradition!
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I thought the party so delightful that it should be documented in a blog post - to serve as a reminder of the roots
                                of the party, and to celebrate the fun time that we all had.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Setting the Stage</h2>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/YWb0cm6/img2021-10-18-1.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Photos of Germany, steins, and pieces of the Berlin Wall.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">First of all, any Oktoberfest worth it's salt must have a proper setting and ambiance. There was a 50ft row of tents
                                set up, for people to shelter under in the event of rain, haybales along the edge of the deck to keep enthusiastic
                                polka-ers from falling off, and many German themed decorations. Pictured above are photo albums from Tim and Anne's trip to Germany, 
                                pieces of the Berlin wall, and some steins. Pictured below are some German folk music vinyls, on display for the 
                                guests to peruse.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/dkhgQpY/img2021-10-18-2.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Some old-timey German folk music vinyls</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Also included on set were some german signs - "Bierhaus, Einfarht, Ausfarht, Tanzaal". There was a cuckoo clock
                                to pretty up the walls, and little straw men sitting on the haybales to greet the party-goers. To add some warmth to a rather grey 
                                day, Tim and Steve got a bonfire going.
                            </p>

                            <span class="caption text-muted">Steve inspecting the hatchet throwing station.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">To get the heart racing, a hatchet throwing stand was set-up in a corner of the yard. Tim had found an old
                                T.V. stand that was perfect for the purpose - we constructed a wooden target, and attached it to the frame. It was a little difficult
                                to get the hatchets to stick, but a few valiant guests did nail the targets with all their hearts.
                            </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">It rained prior to the party, but luckily it stopped and held off once the festivities began. The deck was 
                                a little slippery, but that didn't stop people from putting on their dancing shoes!
                            </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Another classic activity was carrying as many full steins as possible for a distance of 
                                20ft or so. The four participants, Eila, Steve, Sarah, and Jay, all agreed that it was no mean feat.
                            </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The remaining activities were shooting golf balls at a floating target, speaking a german phrase,
                                and of course, socializing and enjoying fine German beer and food.
                            </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">My personal favorite part of the day was sampling all the delicious foods that people brought to the event.
                                There was a selection of more than 10+ beers for people to choose from, and a dizzying array of snacks - from sauerkraut, to
                                spatzli, to apple tarts, pies, struedels, and more. The prize meal of the day was a hearty German sausage.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The Grand Finale</h2>

                            <span class="caption text-muted">Our gracious hosts, Anne and Tim</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Lots of thanks to Anne and Tim for putting on the event! They are pictured above at the welcome table. 
                                In front of them are some classic ceramic steins, and in the background one can see the special german flags that were raised 
                                for the event.
                            </p>

                            <span class="caption text-muted">Finishing off the party with some spectacular fireworks.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The night ended with a round of fireworks. I think the photos turned out quite nicely! Overall, it 
                                was a great Oktoberfest, and I'm much looking forward to the next one. Also, it was a great occasion for making a dirndl, which
                                is something I've wanted to do for a few years now. I will soon make a post dedicated to the construction of that garment.
