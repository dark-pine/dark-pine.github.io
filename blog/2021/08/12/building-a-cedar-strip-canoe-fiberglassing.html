                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Preparing to take the plunge</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Laying up the fiberglass is definitely one of the most nerve-wracking parts of the canoe build. Once the epoxy
                                hits the fiberglass cloth, there is no going back. For this reason, it was important to be extra prepared going into this part
                                of the process! Steve and I watched many videos of other people doing this for their canoes, and also mentally rehearsed together
                                the steps we would take when it came time to do the resin application.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a4f7c055b41566f8fb8fb13fdb057ddb/f8109a9d2d679c43-e7/s1280x1920/7638d5cbc542bb5a3f1891c2bf791927ba2e1168.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">The 2 part epoxy and application tools.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The first step is the mise-en-place. Every surface that the containers for the epoxy would rest on was covered with aluminum
                                foil. This makes cleanup way easier, as drips are unavoidable. The resin used for this canoe was East system 2-part epoxy. The mixing ratio is 5 parts
                                epoxy resin, 1 part hardener. Having pumps that automatically pump in a 5:1 ratio was very convenient. Using mixing containers with marked ratios would
                                have worked as well, but would require more effort each time more epoxy is needed. With the pumps, it was easy to quickly mix more epoxy. Also pictured
                                are brushes, acetone and paper towel for cleanup, squeegees and metal grunge cans for catching the excess epoxy that get squeegeed off the surface of the canoe.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/43dc2c6104918637c265a19a4f01da72/f8109a9d2d679c43-68/s1280x1920/976243e211aefd611b314aa5be92eb1b66b803b8.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Coverals and masks for protection.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The epoxy resin is nasty stuff, not something that you want to breath in, or get on your skin if you can help it. Immediate effects aren't too
                                bad, but over time people have been known to develop sensitivities to it, to the point that they can't even touch their completed canoe. For this reason, it was
                                imperative to wear coverals and respirators.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Outer hull</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The outer hull was messy, with a lot of epoxy dripping onto the ground. Luckily, we had laid a tarp over the floor of the garage in
                                advance, so the mess was fairly contained. It took about 4 coats of epoxy, spread about 2 hours apart. 
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/dcb54644e22c9b562afe684f2ea935b2/f8109a9d2d679c43-bc/s1280x1920/4de7ae6a0d0f5e0fd22d3321e3fa1a030052eb47.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Steve and Eila wetting out the fiberglass on the outer hull.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The first coat is the hardest and takes the most epoxy, as the fiberglass has to be fully saturated until it turns transparent.
                                The next coat still requires squeegeeing. The third coat is applied with a paintbrush, and the final coat was applied with a roller, followed by
                                a foam brush to tip the texture of the coat.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c1f1ec2a527b51f34c0a072245601c8d/f8109a9d2d679c43-01/s1280x1920/6db26962dedbe87e1ad405fad77e578e235ad484.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Sanding the outer hull smooth after fiberglass was cured.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In retrospect, waiting a touch longer between coats would have been good, as there was a lot of runs in the final cured epoxy. This
                                meant a lot more sanding afterwards in order to get the hull smooth. In fact, it was to the point that we applied another coat of epoxy after a round of sanding,
                                in order to get the surface smoothed out. Also, Steve and I had slightly different tolerances for amount of epoxy to squeegee out, meaning the two sides of the hull
                                turned out a little differently. It may have been better to have one person apply the epoxy, and the other squeegee, in order to maintain consistency throughout the coat.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Inner hull</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After doing the outer hull, fiberglassing the inner hull was a lot less daunting. However, the morning of the big day, it was a sweltering humid day.
                                As Steve and I prepared to apply the fiberglass, I realized that we had been shipped the wrong hardener! Instead of the slow-curing hardener, we had the fast hardener.
                                With a looming deadline, we had no choice, and went ahead with the fast hardener. It was scary, and we had to work very fast, but in the end it worked out and the fiberglass
                                cured with no issues in the final finish.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/c5338107a136b5cd50ffb33bc1e20102/f8109a9d2d679c43-98/s1280x1920/a98429410f9539c8cbb918d3b43a3e2d710fe43f.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Preparing to fiberglass the inner hull.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The most important part for laying up the inner fiberglass is to get the cloth nicely positioned before applying the epoxy. Pay attention to
                                how the cloth lays over the stem, and trim the excess to within a half-inch of the sheer line. Then, the rest should go smoothly.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d3aab7de0cd55df047829d8ba3d44fd7/f8109a9d2d679c43-62/s1280x1920/e583943d392337bda7742c445774e4f25fdeb1e6.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Detail shot of fiberglass around the inner stem.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This is how the fiberglass cloth was positioned over the inner stem. If I could do it again, I would also cut a slit along the length of the stem.
                                We got a few airbubbles in this area that were a bit of a pain to go back and fix after the epoxy had cured.

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Applying the epoxy to the inner hull was mostly stressfull because of the fast hardener. However it was a lot tidier in terms of drips, and the care
                                that was taken in properly laying out the cloth in advance paid off.
                            </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">One extra little thing I wanted to add to this canoe was our initials and the year. My thinking is in a few decades, it will be really cool to look
                                at the date on the canoe and think back to who we were at the time of this build. I used a woodburning pen to mark the cedar strips, and the fiberglass was laid on top,
                                so this is a permanent feature of the canoe.
                            </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Once the Inner fiberglass was cured, the hull became a lot stiffer. It started to feel like a boat that could float! At this point in the build,
                                the remaining tasks are finishing the trim, sanding, and varnishing. Up next will be some posts about the trim.
