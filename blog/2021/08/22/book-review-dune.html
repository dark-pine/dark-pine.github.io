                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The Iconic Dune</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">There's been a lot of talk lately about the upcoming Dune movie, and prior to going to see it, I wanted to
                                read the book first. Seeing the movie before reading the book can completely spoil the experience of reading the book for the first time.
                                However, reading the book first doesn't necessarily spoil the movie, rather it can give an even deeper insight into some of the plot
                                lines and details of the world as they unfold on the big screen. Also, Dune was a wildly successful book, and I feel like it's one of those
                                must-read science fictions. So, here goes.
                            </p>
                            <p>I'm taking some notes on it as I read, so that I can give a proper review at the end of it all.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Worldbuilding</h2>
                            <blockquote class="blockquote">It was a relief globe of a world, partly in shadows, spinning under the impetus of a fat hand that glittered with rings.
                                The globe sat on a freeform stand at one wall of a windowless room whose other walls presended a patchwork of multicolored scrolls,
                                filmbooks, tapes and reels. Light glowed in the room from golden balls hanging in mobile-suspensor fields.
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>Wow, I love this passage. The book takes place in some distant futuristic galactic empire, and this alludes to some of their technologies as
                                imagined by Herbert. It has such a steam-punk vibe to it - as if development from the mid-60s went off on a fantastic divergence from
                                the path that progressed into our own modern day technologies. Particularly delicious is the "filmbooks", it's
                                cool seeing how Herbert imagined a portable, handheld video device of sorts, perhaps serving a purpose similar to smartphones, yet utterly
                                locked in the scope of 60s technology, that is, physical books and film.
                            </p>
                            <p>I'm so intruiged by this desert world with it's worms and spice. The preciousness of water is so painfully apparent, I wonder if at the time
                                of writing it there was political talking points about future water wars in our own society? There's also a mystery going on here about why
                                the planet is so barren. It sounds like one day water could be restored...
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The Hero's Journey</h2>
                            <blockquote class="blockquote">It is said a man will come one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye. He will look where
                                we cannot - into both feminine and masculine pasts.
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>Rats, I can already tell that this book is going to be about the one most special man there ever was in existence. It's a common
                                feature of science fiction, some books (for example, Ender's Game) do it more paletably than others (Name of the Wind, I'm looking at you).
                                Right from the get go, we have a tribe of powerful women, who are waiting for the one man to appear that will save them all. Ugh, eyerolls everywhere.
                                It's too bad, I used to be somewhat ignorant of these trends in books. I found it very easy to just identify with the main character and
                                enjoy the story. But it does get old seeing an endless parade of 2-dimensional female supporting characters that are powerful on their own, right
                                until the introduction of the Man. After that, the power dynamic switches and these characters exist to fawn over and defer always to the Hero.
                            </p>
                            <p>I'll try not to gripe too much over this aspect of the novel; it's a product of the time it was written, and I'm still very much interested in the plot.
                                Afterall, Herbert did have to sell copies to target audience that loved this kind of stuff. However, if there are moments where it gets silly enough
                                to annoy me out of enjoying the story, then I'll add it to the "Men writing Women" section.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Comically Evil</h2>
                            <blockquote class="blockquote">"I'll be in my sleeping chambers," the Baron said. "Bring me that young fellow we bought on Gamont, the one
                                with the lovely eyes. Drug him well. I don't feel like wrestling."
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>This passage is supposed to be disgusting, I think, but honestly it made me laugh. Alright, we've established the Baron is the bad guy,
                                now we gotta really emphasize to the reader that he's like, literally, evil! Doesn't look like there'll be much grey area or redemption for this
                                character.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Men writing Women</h2>
                            <p>This section is dedicated to quotes that I think are clear examples of "Men writing women". That is, very weird things for a character to
                                do, and something you would never catch the male lead doing.
                            </p>
                            <blockquote class="blockquote">Jessica twisted her neck, spat out the gag. She pitched hervoice in low, intimate tones,
                                "Gentlemen! No need to fight over me." At the same time, she writhed sinuously for Kinet's benefit.
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>Writhing sinuously. Nice. Can't say I do that very often, nor have I seen a Hero do so.</p>
                            <blockquote class="blockquote">Jessica turned away, frightened of the bitter strength in her son's voice, hearing the precise assessment of chances. She sensed 
                                that his mind had leaped ahead of her, that it now sensed more in some respects than she did. She had helped train the intelligence which did this,
                                but now she found herself fearful of it.
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>Jessica is an incredibly powerful character, but now we're supposed to believe that a narrow escape
                                flipped some kind of a switch and transformed her son? He instantly became soooo much smarter than her, to the point that she
                                looks positively dumb. This was way too abrupt for me, with no progression of Paul as a character learning and going through
                                trials to gain more powers.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Notes after Reading</h2>
                            <p>As the book went on, I'll admit there were actually quite a few good twists. I will say that Jessica as a character
                                still maintained a fair amount of power, and more grey area was introduced with respect to the motivations of the
                                Bene Gesserit. The motivations of the guild, and other characters also became increasingly clear. There was also a revelation that may have explained why the Harkonnen characters
                                were treated with such contempt throughout the book. I belive the author was gunning for maximum impact
                                when that plot point was revealed.
                            </p>
                            <p>I absolutely loved the descriptions of sandworms, and the explanations of their life-cycles and how it
                                all ties together the entire ecosystem of Arrakis. It really is a fantastic world, and a testament to Hebert's imagination.  Overall,
                                I give Dune and 3.5 out of 5 stars. The worldbuilding is great, but the characters are written a little flatly. They gain
                                powers, but too easily, and with no emotional or personality growth as a part of this process. Additionally, the omniscient narraration of
                                their thoughts was a touch too clunky and ham-handed. I believe the book will probably port over to movie form quite nicely, 
                                and I'm looking forward to seeing it in theaters!
                            </p>
