                            <!-- Post content-->
                            <p>There are many ways of building a canoe seat: nylon webbing, shaped plastic, wood planks, and more. But in my
                                mind, the woven cane seat is one of the best. It's a classic, beautiful and natural look that perfectly complements
                                a cedar strip canoe build. It's also quite strong and lightweight. Some people buy prewoven mats of cane or plastic,
                                but weaving it yourself by hand brings the look, feel, and strength to another level. Over the years, the cane will grow brittle and crack,
                                but by going through the process now, it will be easy to repair if the need arises in the future.</p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Prep for weaving cane seats</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I wove these seats as part of the canoe build: Steve built the frames out of ash. They are
                                a simple square frame, with 1/4" holes drilled around the inner perimeter, spaced 3/4" apart.
                                For 1/4" holes, it is recommended to use cane that is 3.5mm wide. I bought a 250ft hank of cane,
                                and it ended up being enough for the 2 seats, with a little to spare. This would not be enough for 3 seats, however.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">The weaving pattern</h2>
                            <p>Before weaving the cane, soak it in water for 15 minutes. This softens the cane and makes it more pliable
                                and less likely to break as you work with it.
                            </p>
                            <p>It's helpful to put pegs in the holes as you weave to help maintain the tension of the cane. I just used a few
                                short pencils to serve as my make-shift pegs.
                            </p>
                            <p>The weaving pattern starts with vertical lines, then horizontal lines laid on top. These layers should be taut, but
                                still with a little play. They will tighten up as more layers of the weave are worked in.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/P1CJZ1b/img2021-08-15-1.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Start with vertical lines, then horizontal lines</span>
                            <p>The next layer is another round of vertical lines. There is still no weaving at this stage, but make sure to place
                                this layer always to the right of the first round of vertical lines.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/Zm7Wq7G/img2021-08-15-2.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Place the 2nd layer or vertical weave slightly to the right of the 1st.</span>
                            <p>The next layer is where the weaving starts to happen. Add horizontal strips that go under the bottom vertical
                                layer, and over the top vertical layer. Position these strips always to the same side of the first horizontal layer.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/7KtHDhF/img2021-08-15-3.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Start weaving with the next horizontal layer.</span>
                            <p>After the first four layers, there should be a grid-like weave. Now to add in the diagonal weaves. The first diagonal weave
                                goes under the horizontal strips, and over the vertical strips. The second diagonal weave goes under the vertical strips, and
                                over the horizontal strips.
                            </p>
                            <p>A unique thing about the diagonal weave is that it should go through the holes in the corners of the frame twice.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/Vm3P6PY/img2021-08-15-4.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">The diagonal layers: 1st is under horizontal strips and over vertical, 2nd is vice versa.</span>
                            <p>Once the weave is complete, cover over the edges for a clean look. This is done with a bit of slightly thicker cane, plus short
                                pieces of the thinner cane that are looped through every hole except for the corners.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/SVc4pfR/img2021-08-15-5.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Sealing off the edge of the weave.</span>
                            <p>With the top of the seat complete, all that is left is to tie off the loose ends on the underside of the seat.
                                Simple half hitches are sufficient to secure the loose ends. It's best to have the ends facing towards the inside of the frame,
                                this way they will be out of the way once trimmed.
                            </p>

                            <span class="caption text-muted">Loose ends all tied up.</span>
                            <p>The completed seat should look pretty good now! Repeat this process twice for the bow and stern seats.
                                When a seat is done, the weave should look like this:</p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://i.ibb.co/th2hpFp/img2021-08-15-7.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">The completed seat.</span>
                            <p>Weaving cane seats is time consuming, but not particularly difficult. The tools I used were an awl, needlenose pliers, and clippers.
                                I used the awl to help make room in the frame holes for the final strands of cane and to lift the cane when I had to loop off the loose ends.
                                The needle nose pliers are helpful for tying the half-hitches at the end of the process, and the clippers were for trimming the cane.
                            </p>
                            <p>The key things are to pay attention to the underside and make sure the loops are distributed evenly, and also to leave some slack
                                in the initial vertical layers of the weave. By taking it one step at a time and doing a bit of weaving here and there, completing
                                the seats should be no problem.
                            </p>
