                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Building up the sides of the hull</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">As I mentioned in the last post, the canoe is 16' long, but our cedar strips were also exactly 16' long.
                                With the curve of the hull factored in, the strips were not long enough to span the whole length of the canoe. As a result,
                                we had to get a little bit creative and butt together multiple strips for the first 20 or so rows of the hull.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d58c5503af9fc59275a4e1bfd35f0129/b8592b86f3429f4b-86/s1280x1920/f5f31249687066d63ab09c38cb42db472fbef484.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Close-up of butt-joint.</span>
                            <p>This picture shows a detail shot of several things. First of all, you can see the butt joint. For each of these joints, we picked
                                a main strip and a butt strip that were close in colour. Then we cut a 45 degree bevel into each, in order to increase the contact
                                area of the strips in the joint. Everywhere there's a butt joint, there's a matching one on the other side of the canoe. We also
                                followed a 4-row pattern for the butt joints, putting them first over station 4 at the bow, then station 4 at the stern, then station 5
                                at the bow, and finally at station 5 at the stern. This way the joints are nicely spread out, but not too random.
                            </p>
                            <p>You can also see how we secured each strip without putting a staple through it. There's a block screwed into the station form that forms the
                                support for the first strip. Additionally, there's a piece of scrap cedar strip that is screwed into the station form that keeps the strips
                                snug together while the glue sets.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/f93b6cc8df298bcc493e55acee883f42/8b2f56ca7787c016-10/s1280x1920/f24b56658bd50538cde3d9636e9ecf367de8bae0.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Sides of the hull getting glued up.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Strip by strip, we would lay down a bit of glue, install the next strip, secure it by screwing scrap bits of cedar into the
                                station forms, using bungee cords, and masking tape in between station forms. Each strip would take at least an hour to dry. Once the glue was
                                set, we'd remove everything and repeat the process. Because of the wait time in between strips, this process took a little over a month, with us
                                averaging between 3 and 4 strips a day.
                            </p>

                            <span class="caption text-muted">Building the hull past the centerline.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Once the walls of the hull were complete, there was some special techniques used to ensure the bottom of the hull would turn out
                                looking good. One side of the bottom was built at a time. Here, you can see that we built the hull past the centerline on one side.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/d1cb4693b793312105c3597f0b97fee3/8b2f56ca7787c016-f0/s1280x1920/bc7926db5a74f1856c6b4738235fbbf76a5e369b.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Excess strips cut away to reveal the centerline.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After all the strips of one side were glued up, we cut away the excess stripping using a chisel. After, we gave it a once-over with
                                the trimming plane to make that line perfectly smooth and flat.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/a2b8adb07599a7a8958c3fe1783f856b/8b2f56ca7787c016-e2/s1280x1920/3be99cb4586afe84be4b25d9021004f22ad9ecf2.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Closing up the hull.</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The other side of the hull took a lot longer. Every strip had to be cut to the correct length, shaped to the correct angle with the trimming
                                plane, and dry-fit to make sure that it fit perfectly into it's place and made a nice "V" with the opposite strip. To add a little stress to this, each strip
                                had been matched with a partner in advance, so there was no back-up plan if a strip got ruined! It took some time and finessing, but in the end I think the
                                bottom of the hull turned out great. The strips match up really nicely, with those perfect "V"s all aligned.
                            </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The outer stems were epoxied dirently to the inner stems. A channel was cut into the cedar strips, so that the outer stem could lay perfectly
                                flat against the inner stem. A fair amount of shaping with the palm plane was required to get the ash outer stems into the desired shape to fit this channel.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/de45c5c2a8a97b5d12d863b72c928a2a/8b2f56ca7787c016-b8/s1280x1920/7187817b7424ca3988b41fdb75289b498495cca0.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">To install the outer stems, first pilot holes were pre-drilled into the stems. The joint between the stems was filled with an epoxy/sawdust
                                mixture, and the stems were screwed into place using wax-coated wood screws. Once the expoy was cured, the screws were removed. Above is Steve faring the outer
                                stem into the hull, once the screws had been taken out.

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">To fill the holes left from the screws, Steve whittled some small pegs. The excess was sawn off and sanded down.

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">While Steve was shaping the outer stems, I was madly faring and sanding the hull to get it ready for the fiberglass. First I went over
                                the whole hull with the block plane, then with 60grit sandpaper. The above photo shows the next step, which was patching all the imperfections in the hull
                                with sawdust and epoxy. The excess epoxy was sanded off with 80grit sandpaper.
                            </p>

                                is protecting it by laying up a fiberglass coat. Next post will be an overview of the fiberglassing process, on the outside as well as the inside of the hull.

                                a real milestone in this build.
