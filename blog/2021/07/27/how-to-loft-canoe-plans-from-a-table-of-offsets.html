                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Getting started with a canoe build</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">At the start of the canoe build, the first decision was picking a canoe design. My two favorites were the Prospector and the Peterborough.
                                Both are famous Canadian canoes: the Prospector renowned for it's ability to carry large loads and handle well in white water, while the Peterborough is the ultimate cottager's canoe,
                                light and easy to paddle in lake conditions. In the end, the Prospector won out, so to get started, I had to draw up the plans of that model.
                            </p>
                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Plotting the table of offsets</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The process of drawing life-size boat plans is called lofting. Typically, lofting is done using a table of offsets that have been measured from some original model.
                                For the prospector, I used the table of offsets provided in "Canoecraft", by Ted Moores. It consisted of two tables, that looked somewhat like this:
                            </p>

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The prospector plans consist of stations, starting at 0, which is the middle of the boat, then incrementing to 7. Each station is placed 1 foot apart, and is mirrored around the middle 0 station.
                                The tables give the x-y and y-x co-ordinates of each station. By plotting these points, you can create the correct curve. The plotted points end up looking something like this:

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Drawing the plans</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">I originally drew the plans for the prospector in open office CAD, then got it printed at Staples. However, the scale got skewed when my design printed, and all my stations ended up being too small!
                                Don't do this. Instead, it's perfectly fine to draw the plans by hand, which is what I did the second time around. To do this, first create a grid of lines 2 inches apart. Each of the vertical lines is a "Butt", or
                                measurement out from the center of the boat. Every horizontal line is a "WL", aka a measurement up from the waterline, or base of the boat. Each Butt has a height point that gets plotted, and each WL has a half-breadth
                                that gets plotted. Once all the points for a station are on the paper, a smooth curve can then be drawn between them with the help of some nails and a thin bendy piece of wood, a batten.
                            </p>
                            <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/8a53862ecd5d4ec2d3f696bc81e84738/dff09c30319f51ef-4b/s1280x1920/87dc794d39da265608f4e3f0681b3c37a5414a6b.jpg" alt="..." /></figure>
                            <span class="caption text-muted">Drawing a smooth curve with some nails and a batten</span>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">All the stations should be drawn on the same piece of paper, that way you can check that they are proportionate to each other and that no obvious mistakes have been made! When it comes time to cut out the
                                forms, first trace out Station 0, the widest form. Then, the paper can be trimmed down to the next station, and those forms traced. And so on, all the way until Station 7 is complete.
                            </p>

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">In summary</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">At first, the tables of offsets looked intimidating, with so many numbers and trying to figure out how the co-ordinates worked. Once the (x-y)/(y-x) distinction became clear,
                                plotting the plans wasn't that bad. The main thing is to take time to draw the grid out correctly, with 90 degree angles and proper spacing.
                                Then double check the points are all plotted correctly, and the plans are to scale. Getting the plans right will save many head-aches down the road!
                                The last thing you want to do is have to re-cut all the station forms like me.
