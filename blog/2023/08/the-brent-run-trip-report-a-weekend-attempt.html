                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">The Brent Run. It's a legendary race through Algonquin Park that Steve and I have been wanting to give a go since December 2022.
                                If you're unfamiliar with the lore behind this race, here's a

                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In a nutshell: we paddled from Canoe Lake to Lost Joe Lake on Friday night.
                                Saturday we touched the waters of Perley Lake, but knew we had hit a wall so turned back down Burnt Root Lake.
                                Sunday we paddled from Burnt Root Lake all the way back to Canoe lake. In total, we paddled 11+50+45=106km, 2+12+11=25hr over the weekend!</p>

                            <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Trip Prep</h2>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">This summer we have not been able to paddle as much as we would like, so we knew we would be getting into quite a battle.
                                Prep mostly consisted of packing up everything we thought we would need for the attempt, while trying our best to minimize the weight.
                                We managed to get everything into my large backpack, Steve's small daybag, and our 30L barrel.
                                In retrospect, there were definitely items we could have left behind (looking at you, 2 books and journal that we were too exhausted to use).

                                With this set of gear, we were able to run the portages in a single trip. Steve took the canoe and barrel,
                                and I took the two packs and our paddles.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                Our main take-aways from our attempt are that if we are dead serious about finishing the run in a weekend,
                                we probably want to get everything to fit into the big backpack.
                                That way, on the portage Steve can handle the canoe, and I'll take the pack and paddles.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                                The books and journal, as well as mini gatorades would be the first to go.
                                Instead of the water filter, we would do chlorine tablets.
                                Instead of gatorade, electrolyte powder.
                                We also would likely ditch the stove and pot and eat strictly dried foods: prepped sandwiches, jerkey, dried fruits/trail mix, and cliff bars.
                                Skipping the barrel, we'd do a bear hang with a drybag, and try to camp for max 5-8 hours.
